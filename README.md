ðŸš€ 3D Portfolio Website
This is a modern, interactive portfolio website built using React and Framer Motion. The site showcases a collection of personal and professional projects through cleanly designed animated cards. Each project card includes the project title, description, preview image, and external links (if available).

The layout is responsive and grid-based, making it look great on both desktop and mobile devices. A special transparent card labeled "Coming Soon" is always shown at the end, indicating that more exciting projects are in progress and will be added soon.

This project focuses on smooth animations, a user-friendly interface, and minimal yet engaging design. All components are modular and reusable, making it easy to expand or customize.
